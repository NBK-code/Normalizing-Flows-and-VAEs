# Normalizing Flows and Variational Autoencoders

This notebook is suppose to provide a fun exploration of normalizing flows and variational autoencoders. The notebook is divided into two parts. In the first part, we create a synthetic image dataset with a normalizing flow generated by random parameters. The dataset comes from the contour plots of a transformed distribution. In the second part of the notebook, we use the dataset to train a variational autoencoder and then use the trained model to interpolate between the generated images.
